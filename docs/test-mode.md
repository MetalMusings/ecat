# Test mode

EtherCAT Setup's Test page runs the configuration being edited, saved or
not, in `halrun` with the `ecat` component and a servo thread, without
LinuxCNC. It is the same code that runs the machine.

Before starting it, stop LinuxCNC and the kernel master
(`sudo systemctl stop ethercat`). The free-running master
(`ethercat-uspace start`) hands the bus over to the test by itself and
does not come back when the test stops.

## I/O

Each slave's inputs show live; the outputs of I/O slaves can be set.
Pins set during the test go back to 0 before it stops. SDOs can be read
and written from the same page whenever a master runs; objects that are
commands rather than settings (such as `0x2010` on the ECT60), objects in
the process data, and a drive's CiA 402 objects are refused.

When the test stops, every drive is disabled, the outputs go to zero, and
the slaves are taken to PREOP while process data still flows
(`ecat.take-down`; the component's stop guard would do it too), so that
they stop without an error.

## Moving a drive

A CiA 402 drive in CSP can be moved in small steps. Safety comes in
layers, so that no single one has to be perfect:

1. **Nothing moves without a deliberate act.** The drive is enabled only
   while *Hold to enable* or a jog button is held, with the mouse or the
   space bar. Releasing it disables the drive; so does the window losing
   focus.
2. **Heartbeat.** Every drive's `watchdog-ms` is set to 500 ms in the
   test's HAL file, and the window counts the `watchdog` pin up every
   100 ms. If the window hangs or dies, the servo thread shuts the drive
   down by itself (`fault-reason` 5).
3. **Limits in the drive.** *Write limits to the drive* reads the drive's
   own values and writes, where the drive has the objects:
   - software position limits `0x607D` at ± the travel around the
     position at that moment;
   - a tight following-error window: `0x6065`, or the vendor's object
     (on the Rtelligent ECT60, `0x2022` "Position trace error Limit");
   - the maximum torque `0x6072`.

   The drive's own values are kept in
   `~/.local/state/ecatsetup/drive-limits.json` before each limit is
   written, and written back by *Done* or when the test stops; if the
   program dies in between, it offers to write them back at its next
   start.
4. **Limits in HAL.** The drive's `pos-cmd` comes from a `limit3` with the
   test's velocity, acceleration and travel, in the servo thread. Until
   the drive is in "Operation enabled", the `limit3` follows `pos-fb`, so
   enabling never makes a jump; a jog moves its target by one step, never
   past the travel.

Defaults: 5 mm/s, 50 mm/s², ± 20 mm, following error 2 mm, torque 30 %.
The scale (counts per mm) is taken from the configuration's HAL files
(`setp <drive>.pos-scale ...`) when they have it.

What the ECT60 has: `0x607D` and `0x2022`, no `0x6080`, `0x6072` or
`0x6065`, so its velocity and torque are limited in HAL only. Whether it
honours `0x607D` in CSP is to be seen in the first test at the machine.

## First test at the machine

Built and tried without motion on the plasma cutter (2026-11-09): the
limits were written to X, read back and put back; the drive stayed
disabled. The first motion needs someone at the machine:

1. E-stop within reach; the axis away from its ends.
2. Start the test, choose the drive (X first), check the scale, and
   *Write limits to the drive*. The banner lists what was written.
3. If the drive shows Fault, hold *Reset fault*.
4. Hold *Hold to enable* without jogging: the drive should reach
   "Operation enabled" and not move. Release: it goes back to "Switched
   on" or "Ready to switch on".
5. Step 0.1 mm, hold *Jog +*: the position should change by 0.1 mm.
   Then 1 mm, both directions.
6. Check the heartbeat: while holding *Hold to enable*, stop the window
   (for example `kill -STOP` of its process from a terminal). The drive
   should be disabled within half a second (`fault-reason` 5). `kill -CONT`
   it again.
7. *Done* writes the drive's own limits back; check them with an SDO
   read (`0x607D:01`, `0x607D:02`, `0x2022`).
